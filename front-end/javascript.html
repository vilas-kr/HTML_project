    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile and popular scripting language primarily used for adding interactive and dynamic functionality to 
        web pages. It's a high-level, interpreted language that runs in the user's web browser, making it essential for front-end development.
        JavaScript can also be used for server-side development and other applications like mobile apps, browser extensions, and even virtual
        reality experiences. </p>
