    <center><h1>Node.js</h1></center>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code
        outside of a web browser. It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its
        high performance.</p>
    <p>
        Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications, particularly server-side applications, but can
        also be used for command-line tools and desktop applications. It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
        model,which allows it to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently. This makes it suitable for real-time
        applications, APIs, and microservices. </p>
