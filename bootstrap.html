    <p>Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed HTML, 
        CSS, and JavaScript components for creating responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. It was initially 
        developed at Twitter and has since become a widely used tool in the web development community. </p>
